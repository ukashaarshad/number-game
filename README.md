Number Game Project

This is a dice game where players take turns rolling the dice, aiming to accumulate the highest score possible without risking to loss it.

Here are the rules:

The active player has the option to hold their current score at any point or to continue rolling for a chance to increase it.
If the active player rolls a 1 on the dice, they lose all their accumulated score, and it becomes the other player's turn.
The game concludes when one player reaches a score of 100 or more, and that player is declared the winner.
